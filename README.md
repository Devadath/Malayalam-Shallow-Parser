# Malayalam-Shallow-Parser

This is a Shallow Parser for Malayalam which I have developed as a part of my MPhil program at IIIT-Hyderabad, India.

# Prerequisites
Make sure that you have installed crf++.  If not, install the latest version from https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/. Currently this system is tested only in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

* For tokenising I have used the tokenisor from https://github.com/ltrc/indic-tokenizer, which is already present in this directory.

# Usage :
- 1) $ cd  Malayalam-Shallow-Parser
- 2) Replace text in the file "input.txt" with your text.
- 3) $ sh shallowPaser.sh
