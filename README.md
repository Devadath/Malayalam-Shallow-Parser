# Malayalam-Shallow-Parser

Make sure that you have installed crf++.  If not, install the latest version from https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/.

Currently this system is tested only in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

For tokenising I have used the tokenisor from https://github.com/ltrc/indic-tokenizer.


- 1) $ cd  Malayalam-Shallow-Parser
- 2) Replace text in the file "input.txt" with your text.
- 3) $ sh shallowPaser.sh
